# Perl's Role in Bootstrapping the Web

Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, often mentions that "Perl was used to bootstrap the web." This statement refers to several key roles Perl played in the early days of the World Wide Web (early-to-mid 1990s):

## 1. CGI Scripts
Perl was the dominant language for writing CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts, which were the first way to create dynamic web pages. Before PHP, Python web frameworks, or JavaScript, Perl CGI scripts were how most websites handled:
- Form processing
- Database connections
- Dynamic content generation
- User authentication

## 2. Web Server Management
- System administrators heavily used Perl for log processing
- Apache web server configuration and management
- URL rewriting and redirection

## 3. Early Web Tools
- Many early web crawlers were written in Perl
- Web log analyzers
- Site maintenance tools
- Early content management systems

## 4. Text Processing Strength
- Perl's strong text processing capabilities made it ideal for handling HTML
- Regular expressions in Perl became the standard for pattern matching on the web
- URL parsing and manipulation

The term "bootstrap" here means that Perl provided the initial infrastructure and tools that helped the web grow from a collection of static pages into a platform for dynamic applications. It was the "glue language" that helped build and maintain the early web infrastructure before more specialized web technologies emerged.

This role was so significant that Perl was sometimes called "the duct tape of the Internet" during this period.
