# CPSC-354 Report Repository

This repository contains my semester-long report for **Principles of Programming Languages (CPSC-354, 2025)**.  
The report is written in **LaTeX** and compiled weekly to include homework assignments, lecture summaries, and other required submissions.  

## Structure
- `.gitignore` → keeps LaTeX build files and editor junk out of version control.  
- `report/`  
  - `report.tex` → the LaTeX source for the report.  
  - `report.pdf` → the compiled report, updated weekly with new homework.  
  
## Workflow
- This report is **continuously updated** throughout the semester.  
- Weekly homework is added to `report.tex` and recompiled into `report.pdf`.  
- The final version will contain all assignments, lecture notes, and the concluding essay.  

## Notes
- Only `report.tex` and `report.pdf` are kept in version control — all LaTeX auxiliary files are ignored via `.gitignore`.  
- The history of the report can be seen in the commit log, reflecting incremental progress across the semester.
